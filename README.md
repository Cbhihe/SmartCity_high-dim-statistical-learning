## ml -- Machine Learning

#### Content:
Some of the work presented here is concerned with mere toy examples meant for others to hone their ML skills. They are mostly those in folders named Lab1, Lab2, etc. Other developments are more personal and involve a greater amount of coding using R and / or python scripting. This repo also contains a project in deep learning, housed in the folder Project, with its own introductoury ***readme.md*** file. . Altogther various areas are covered by the contents in a more or less detailed fashion:
- regression (linear and beyond)
- classification (incl. generative and discriminative classifiers)
- clustering: k-means and E-M
- learning with kernels: SVM and kernel functions
- artificial neural networks (NN): Delta rule, MLP-1, MLP-2, RBF, DL and CNNs
- ensemble methods: Random Forests

#### Data-sets:
Some of the public domain data set used to perfom analyses were not uploaded on this repo due to the size limitation on individual files imposed by GitHub. In such cases at least a snapshot of the data sets is provided as well as a URL, where it can be downloaded. The downloaded data set may or may not be identical to the one originally used to obtain results presented here. The responsability for that falls squarely on the data maintainer. In practice however, interested people may still benefit from the strategy laid out to deal with the data, irrespectively of whether some of the data as changed. Data set changes over the years (if any) are likely to be all or nothing in any case; i.e. a data set may altogether cease to be available because the website has disappeared or moved.
